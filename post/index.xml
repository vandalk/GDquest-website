      <description>Last week-end we went to the Capitole du Libre, a major event around Free Software in France, to showcase Godot. We met there with Gilles Roudière and Julian Murgia, two active contributors.
It was a busy event: even though there were fewer visitors than at FOSDEM, people kept coming to the Godot table, curious about the engine&amp;rsquo;s features.
Julian and Gilles gave a two-hours workshop based on @KidsCanCode&amp;rsquo;s Your first game  tutorial.</description>

      <description>Last week we did a tutorial about attack mechanics in collaboration with Heartbeast. I got important feedback from you, the backers, and wanted to apply it to a self-contained tutorial. Consider it as a bonus while we&amp;rsquo;re waiting for Godot 3 beta.
Close combat attack:
 Weapon Animation  Weapon collision programming   Heartbeast&amp;rsquo;s tutorial:
 Ranged attack: fireball   It shows some of Godot&amp;rsquo;s strengths:
 Inherited scenes act as a base class that child scenes derive from, but you control it all through the editor.</description>

      <description>Godot 3 is coming out much later than planned. Alpha 2 isn&amp;rsquo;t even out yet. This means breaking changes keep happening on the engine. In the past few weeks alone there were important improvements to 2D physics and the UI system. The devs even renamed _fixed_process to _physics_process. Today I finished a long UI design tutorial only to learn a new Layout menu just arrived.
  This tutorial will show you how to create a flexible GUI in Godot   If I produced gameplay programming videos now for the course, they&amp;rsquo;d soon become obsolete.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a year already. 12 months, 12 consecutive updates. This anniversary release may not seem like much, but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly the biggest so far. I redesigned all the brushes from scratch! The new thumbnails are circular. That way, all the information they can convey is available whether you look at the pop-up palette or the presets list. The design is also unique so that it’s easy to differentiate from other bundles.</description>

      <description>Update: the form&amp;rsquo;s results are available: Check them out!
Back in December 2015, hundreds supported gdquest on Kickstarter to bring out game art tutorials to Krita. Since then, I produced more than a hundred videos for it, and the first professional game art course.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to go full time with GDquest. Back then there was no website, a small community, I had few contacts to help me and no experience with crowdfunding.</description>

      <description>The past 2 months have been hectic. I’ll pass on the details, but since a few days, I’m renting an office. After so much time struggling to work from home, you can’t imagine how great it feels! I not only have access to the room 24/7, it’s also part of a local business incubator. The structure offer a lot of support, free training on accounting, management, legal stuff… All of which is quite complex in France.</description>

      <description>Yes, I’m back from Japan! Physically at least: my heart is still back there. I’ve been traveling around the country for a bit less than a month, and the experience was incredible. It was a great occasion to practice Japanese and get a better sense for the culture. I’ve read and been told a lot of things before going, and reality felt a lot subtler than what you would expect at first.</description>

The short version: I kept improving the website, went to the biggest yearly KDE development sprint in Randa, Switzerland, and added about 1h of tutorials dedicated to Krita 3&amp;rsquo;s new features in the Krita training. You can find more details about what happened in Randa, and what the plans are for July, below.</description>

      <description>Never heard of Krita? It is a free, open source digital painting program that used to be Linux-only. Since 2 years though, there&amp;rsquo;s a Windows version, and the program is now being ported to Mac.
Krita 3 is a major update to an already powerful application. It brings it to a whole new level. It ships with a new rendering engine, a traditional animation toolset, an overhauled layers docker, rulers, grid, guides, snapping support, and a brand-new tablet code, which supports more Wacom alternatives.</description>

      <description>This tutorial is a post I initially wrote on the Hugo forums. Hugo is the static website generator that powers GDquest. It is a really flexible and elegant system, based on Google&amp;rsquo;s Go programming language. Sometimes, it is a bit hard to use for a non-tech-savvy user. So I decided to share some tips on things that got me stuck at some point. 
In a template, you sometimes need to load data from a path based on a parameter in your content file’s front matter.</description>

      <description>Recommended graphic tablets On this page, you can find a list of the graphic tablets I recommend for Game Art Quest. I used Frenden&amp;rsquo;s reviews as a reference to pick affordable tablets you can try out. I also asked feedback to fellow professionals who use Huion devices, as I only have Wacom tablets here. When you buy a graphic tablet, be sure to test your device and to use your right of withdrawal in case you don&amp;rsquo;t like it.</description>

With one last contract finished last week, and the series on monster design done, I am now working full-time on Game Art Quest. My top priority is to release the first version of the GAQ Krita brush back and to finish chapter 0 in the training.</description>
