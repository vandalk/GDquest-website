      <description>The past 2 months have been hectic. I’ll pass on the details, but since a few days, I’m renting an office. After so much time struggling to work from home, you can’t imagine how great it feels! I not only have access to the room 24/7, it’s also part of a local business incubator. The structure offer a lot of support, free training on accounting, management, legal stuff… All of which is quite complex in France.</description>

      <description>Yes, I’m back from Japan! Physically at least: my heart is still back there. I’ve been traveling around the country for a bit less than a month, and the experience was incredible. It was a great occasion to practice Japanese and get a better sense for the culture. I’ve read and been told a lot of things before going, and reality felt a lot subtler than what you would expect at first.</description>

      <description>Yes, the first volume of Game Art Quest is done. 6.2 hours of free Krita tutorials (some are still upcoming on the channel). 7 hours if you include the first bonus series of the year: Introduction to monster design for 2-D games. Looking back at the Kickstarter description, this is already more than the promised as far as the total length is concerned.
 Early access  Available tutorials (free)  The extra premium brushes and their companion tutorials are also getting pretty big.</description>

      <description>It has been a while since the last behind the scenes news post. There&amp;rsquo;s been good progress with the tutorials and the brushes. I&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work lately, especially changing my workflow to increase production speed, maintaining the same quality. On the other hand, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to update the website and social networks as often as I would&amp;rsquo;ve liked. Aside from that&amp;hellip;
Krita 3.0.1 is out! Krita 3.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re getting to the end of June. It&amp;rsquo;s time to sum up all that&amp;rsquo;s been happening this month. The short version: I kept improving the website, went to the biggest yearly KDE development sprint in Randa, Switzerland, and added about 1h of tutorials dedicated to Krita 3&amp;rsquo;s new features in the Krita training. You can find more details about what happened in Randa, and what the plans are for July, below.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;May has been a busy month. I did my best to keep up with everyone on social networks, to give a hand to the Krita developers, with their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjIiI8uiVNM&#34;&gt;Kickstarter campaign&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip; But I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the time to write longer news posts like this one. Time to share the news for this month! &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hi there! I wanted to keep you posted on what is going on right now with GDquest. The video says it all, but I’m going to sum up the news below.
With one last contract finished last week, and the series on monster design done, I am now working full-time on Game Art Quest. My top priority is to release the first version of the GAQ Krita brush back and to finish chapter 0 in the training.</description>
