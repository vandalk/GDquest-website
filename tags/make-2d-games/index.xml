      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s make the first professional 2-D game creation course for the Godot game engine a reality! The Kickstarter is now live. The higher the funding goes, the more content you will get. Every single cent will go to the project.
On top of that, for the next 30 days, you will get a free tutorial every day on YouTube.
Learn to create your own 2d game inspired by Zelda! Back the Kickstarter now and get at least 50% of final course&amp;rsquo;s price!</description>
